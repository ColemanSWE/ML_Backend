# ML_Backend
Took a sample data set from Kaggle that deals with American political Facebook posts from a few news sources and made a simple regression model from it. I then implemented the model in a localhost Flask app that will return the likelihood of a Facebook post being true when queried with a JSON object containing info about the post. 

# Note: The ML practices in this are possibly shaky at best. Just an excuse to pull out SKLearn and Pandas while wanting to do a nice backend project. :)
